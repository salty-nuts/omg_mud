NEW COMMANDS AND NEW MUD BEHAVIOR:
---------------------------------
**  New preference editor for players: prefedit. Use it to enable two new
    toggles autodoor and autokey.

**  Added a new command to cancel all pending (queued) commands. For example
    a fighting player that has spammed 10 kick or spell commands can type
    '--' to cancel them all so they can instead flee.

**  New automap shows a small ascii map to the right of room descriptions.
    Toggle automap on to enable. There is also a new map command that can
    show a larger map area.

**  Doors are now visible in the exits menu. i.e. Exits: n (e) w s.

**  New toggles: autoloot, autogold, autosplit, autosac, and autoassist.

**  You can now use the history command to see a log of all channels.

**  NEW AFK toggle that displays in your prompt, under who, and when people
    look at the room.

**  You can now use color! @RHELP COLORCODES@n.

    (not even visible with detect invis and sense life).

**  You can now set your pagelength and pagewidth!

**  You can now "look around" to see anything of interest in the room. But,
    some things may still be hidden and require further investigation.

**  You can now use "all" and "all.x" very generally with the get, put, drop, 
    junk, donate, give, wear and remove commands.  Type HELP GET for more info.

**  The "track" function will show you the first step on the shortest path to 
    anyone in the game.

    someone else's name in parentheses in the message header, they will be 
    able to remove the message too.

    entrance to the Grunting Boar inn.  Stamps cost 150 coins.

    containers from fountains using the FILL command.

**  When you are writing a message, you will now not be interrupted by tells, 
    shouts, emotes, socials, and even people talking in the same room.

**  Use the ASSIST command to engage in mortal combat with someone in the room
    who is getting pummeled.

**  Use the SPLIT command to split gold among the members of your group 
    (including yourself) who are in the room.  i.e. If you are in a group
    with 4 other people who are in the room with you, type "SPLIT 100"
    to give each of them 20 coins.

**  You can use the VISIBLE command to break a spell of invisibility before
    it expires.
