Wyvern guard commander wyv~
the wyvern guard commander~
A mighty wyvern stands here defending his city.
~
   This huge wyvern holds himself with military precision.  His claws are
extremely sharp as if he has taken the time to file them to fine points.  His
scales are a dull red and flex over the massive muscles underneath his hide.  
His glance scans the room and focuses on you intently.  He crooks one huge talon
as you look at him as if to ask what you want from him, better not waist his
time.

A monster made entirely of heat walks here in human form.

   This figure looks vaguely human in shape but keeps wavering in the light.  
Waves of heated air flow from it and you wonder what kind of energy it took to

A gigantic red dragon lies here blocking your way.

   This huge dragon sprawls across your way leaving you only a little room to
pass by it.  Smoke and hot air Jet forth from its fanged maw and nostrils, while
sparks of reddish light reflect off its deep red scales and the treasure
imbedded in its belli.  Its eyes are closed and although it is over 100 feet
long if it is sleeping..  You might be able to get passed it.  What a guardian!
