Wyvern guard commander wyv~
the wyvern guard commander~
A mighty wyvern stands here defending his city.
~
   This huge wyvern holds himself with military precision.  His claws are
extremely sharp as if he has taken the time to file them to fine points.  His
scales are a dull red and flex over the massive muscles underneath his hide.  
His glance scans the room and focuses on you intently.  He crooks one huge talon
as you look at him as if to ask what you want from him, better not waist his
time.
