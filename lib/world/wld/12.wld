around the table, all empty.  The Immortal Board Room is to the north.

The Post Office Of The Gods~
   The Post Office Of The Gods is the same as most Post Offices except that it
is not as slow.  Even the Postal service knows not to anger the Gods.  Piles of
junk mail line the walls.  I guess even Gods get on mailing lists.  The northern
foyer is to the west.
