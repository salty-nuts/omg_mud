Dense Jungle~
Oppressive humidity hangs heavy in the air, thick with the scent of decaying
vegetation and exotic flowers.  Sunlight struggles to penetrate the dense canopy
overhead, casting the jungle floor in an emerald twilight.  Vines as thick as a
man's arm strangle the gnarled trees, and the air is alive with the buzzing of
unseen insects and the squawking of unseen birds.

Artificial Shadow~
A stifling gloom blankets the jungle floor beneath the colossal bulk of the
Aztec temple.  Sunlight struggles to pierce the overhang, casting an unnatural
darkness that feels oppressive and heavy.  The air is thick with the scent of
damp earth and decaying leaves.  The vibrant jungle sounds from the previous
area are muffled here, replaced by an unsettling silence broken only by the
occasional drip of water or the rustle of unseen creatures in the undergrowth.

Base of the Pyramid~
You emerge from the oppressive jungle into a vast, open space dominated by the
sheer immensity of the Aztec pyramid.  Its base stretches out before you like a
colossal, man-made mountain.  Jagged, weathered stone blocks rise high into the
sky, their surfaces etched with intricate glyphs and weathered by countless
years.

The sheer drop to the jungle floor below takes your breath away.  Here, the air
vibrates with the incessant chatter of exotic birds and the distant screech of
monkeys.  The landing itself is a marvel of Aztec engineering.  Polished
obsidian tiles form a smooth walkway underfoot, their surface cool and slightly
slick.  The eastern wall rises high above you, adorned with vivid murals
depicting scenes of Aztec mythology and warriors clad in jaguar pelts.

steps carved into the eastern wall lead steeply downward, disappearing into an
inky blackness below.  A chilling wind carrying faint whispers and mournful
wails blows from the depths, sending shivers down your spine.

The Bridge of Bones~
A rickety bridge fashioned from bleached human bones spans the width of this
chamber, connecting two obsidian platforms hovering over a bottomless chasm.  
An ethereal, greenish fog obscures the depths below, and the air is thick with
the stench of decay.  Skeletal figures, their empty sockets filled with
flickering green flames, shamble aimlessly on the platforms, their mournful
moans echoing through the chamber.

The Obsidian Throne~
The air in this vast chamber hangs heavy with a cold, oppressive chill.  In the
center, a colossal obsidian throne carved with grotesque skulls and writhing
serpents dominates the scene.  Atop the throne sits Mictlantecuhtli, the
skeletal god of the underworld.  His hollow eyes, burning with an eerie green
light, pierce through the darkness as he gazes upon you.  Jagged obsidian shards
pierce his skeletal frame, a gruesome reminder of the sacrifices he claims.

The Trial of Wind~
This chamber is dominated by a series of wind tunnels carved into the south
wall.  Each tunnel is roughly chest-high and varies in width, creating a
maze-like obstacle course.  A constant, howling wind whips through the tunnels,
carrying whispers of forgotten languages and the faint scent of ozone.
