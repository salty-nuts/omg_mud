claw red dragon cinderheart~
The Claw of Cinderheart is more than a weapon it's a potent relic.  Crafted from
the severed claw of Cinderheart, the infamous King of Red Dragons, the gauntlet
hums with a captured fire.  The polished crimson scales, rumored to be part of
Cinderheart's own hide, shimmer with an otherworldly sheen.  Intricate runes
etched upon each scale glow faintly when the weapon is activated, pulsing with a
power that both mesmerizes and terrifies.
