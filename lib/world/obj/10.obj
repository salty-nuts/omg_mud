Hardtack is a dense, dry biscuit made from a simple dough of flour, water, and
sometimes salt.  It's about half an inch thick and baked rock-solid.  Soldiers
and sailors often soak it in water, dunk it in coffee, or crumble it before
eating.  Despite the bland taste, it's a valuable food source because it's
cheap, lasts a very long time, and packs a lot of calories.
