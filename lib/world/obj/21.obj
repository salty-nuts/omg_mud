the Obsidian Throne~
This colossal throne, forged from a single block of polished obsidian, dominates the chamber.~
The back of the throne depicts a colossal skull, its hollow eye sockets filled
with flickering green flames that mirror Mictlantecuhtli's own.  Jagged obsidian
spikes erupt from the armrests, hinting at the countless sacrifices made to
appease the lord of the underworld.  These spikes are slick with a sickly green
ichor, the lingering residue of past offerings.

the Ribcage Key~
This key is a horrifying yet strangely beautiful object.~
Carved from a single, polished human ribcage, it retains a faint, eerie
luminescence.  The spine serves as the shaft, vertebrae meticulously smoothed
and polished.  Each rib curves gracefully outward, forming intricate grooves
along its underside.  In the center of the ribcage, where the sternum would be,
a single, jagged obsidian shard protrudes, its sharp edge glinting menacingly.

femur meets the shaft, is a grotesque skull.  The empty sockets seem to peer
into the living world with an insatiable hunger, and the gaping maw appears
ready to devour any who dare approach.

remains a mystery, whispered to be a fragment of Xolotl's own fiery essence
trapped within the obsidian.

Crafted from a single block of polished obsidian, the mask reflects the dim
light of the underworld with an eerie sheen.  Shaped like the fearsome head of a
jaguar, the mask is a potent symbol of Mictecacihuatl's power.  The obsidian
carver has captured the essence of the predator in every detail - the narrowed
eyes, the powerful jaw, and the snarling snarl.  The Fangs of Mictlan serve a
dual purpose.  On a practical level, the obsidian offers some protection against
those who might seek to challenge her authority.  More importantly, the mask
serves as a powerful symbol of Mictecacihuatl's dominion over the underworld.  
The jaguar, a creature of the night and a skilled hunter, embodies the dangers
that lurk within her domain.  The bared fangs are a stark reminder of the
finality of death, a chilling message to those who dare to trespass.

an eerie inner light.  A closer inspection reveals a horrifying truth.  These
aren't the bones of a single monstrous creature, but a macabre tapestry woven
from the fused ribs of countless souls trapped within Mictlan.  Ach individual
rib retains a faint echo of its former owner, a ghostly shimmer that dances
within the polished bone.  Some writhe in silent agony, others seem resigned to
their fate.  The glyphs etched upon them, said to be the laments of the damned,
writhe and shift like living things, adding to the unsettling spectacle.
