crown oak leaves~
   This crown isn't crafted from precious metals or glittering jewels.  
Instead, it boasts a unique beauty derived from nature itself.  Coiled tightly,
a band of sturdy oak leaves forms a circle, their edges catching the light with
a subtle golden sheen.  The leaves themselves, though carefully chosen, retain
their natural imperfections the occasional brown spot or jagged tear.  Yet,
these imperfections only add to the crown's character, speaking of a power that
is both natural and enduring.

war club orc chief~
   The War Club of the Orc Chief is a weapon that inspires terror and respect in
equal measure.  Forged not from refined steel, but from the gnarled and twisted
heart of an ancient ironwood tree, the club exudes a sense of raw, untamed
power.  The handle, thick enough to require two hands to wield effectively, is
pitted and scarred, each mark a testament to a past battle.  At the business
end, a massive chunk of obsidian has been crudely but effectively lashed to the
wood.
