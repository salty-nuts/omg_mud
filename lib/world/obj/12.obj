The Sigil of the Blood Moon isn't your ordinary light source.  Forget flickering
flames or warm lanterns.  This is an orb, a swirling vortex of crimson energy
held captive within a transparent sphere.  The color isn't just red, it's the
deep, vibrant red of fresh blood, pulsing with an inner light that seems to
radiate a faint heat even at a distance.
